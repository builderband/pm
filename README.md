# ðŸ’¿ Builderband Project Management Repository

This repository serves project management for various initiatives affecting the Gitcoin Builderband. The primary use of this repository is for Builderband meetings.

## Builderband Meetings
### Purpose
The Builderband meeting is a professional call intended to bring together various Gitcoin builders who made a substantial income in the Gitcoin ecosystem. Gitcoin builders provide updates on their projects, discuss Gitcoin [hackathons](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons), [grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/), [governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/) issues, and support each other as we **build** the decentralized web.

### Agendas
We track the agenda for these calls in the Issues tab of this repository, under the "agenda" label ([link](https://github.com/leoneric/builderband/issues?q=label%3A%22agenda%22+)). To add an item to a meeting schedule, please [open an issue in this repository](https://github.com/leoneric/builderband/issues) that mentions the topic you want to discuss and links any relevant materials (hackathon bounties, prototypes, governance proposals, etc.). Then, leave a comment in the meeting agenda where you would like to discuss this. You can see an example here. You can see an example [here](https://github.com/leoneric/builderband/issues/1#issuecomment-981077553).

Any Builderband member is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows these guidelines:
- The topic concerns builders.
- The topic involves the Gitcoin ecosystem at a low level -- this means projects that don't concern the Builderband and Gitcoin hackathons, grants, and governance are generally not allowed as topics.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The Builderband meetings should not decide contentious philosophical issues that the community should decide. Of course, there are exceptions to this, but generally, these topics distract from more productive builder discussions.

### Who Can Attend
We invite Gitcoin Builderband members and Gitcoin Core team members core to attend the meetings. Sometimes, we ask an external builders with particular expertise to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the discussions by your attendance, please reach out to [Leon Erichsen](mailto:leon@gitcoin.co).
