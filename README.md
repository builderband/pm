# Builderband Project Management Repository
Gitcoin's High-Performance Alumni Network

This repository serves project management for various initiatives affecting the Gitcoin Builderband. The primary use of this repository is for Builderband meetings.

## Builderband meetings
### Purpose
The Builderband meeting is a professional call intended to bring together various Gitcoin builders who performed notable gigs in the Gitcoin ecosystem. Gitcoin builders provide updates on their projects, discuss various Gitcoin [hackathons](https://gitcoin.co/hackathons) and [governance](https://gov.gitcoin.co/) issues to improve projects, and support each other as we **build** Web 3.

### Agendas
We track the agenda for these calls in the Issues tab of this repository, under the "agenda" label (link). To add an item to a meeting schedule, please [open an issue in this repository](https://github.com/leoneric/builderband/issues) that mentions the topic you want to discuss and links any relevant materials (hackathon bounties, prototypes, governance proposals etc.). Then, leave a comment in the agenda where you would like this to be discussed. You can see an example here.You can see an example here.

Any Builderband member is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows these guidelines:
- The topic concerns builders.
- The topic involves the Gitcoin ecosystem at a low level -- this means projects that don't concern Gitcoin hackathons and governance directly are generally not allowed as topics.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The Builderband meetings should not decide contentious philosophical issues that the community should decide. There are exceptions to this, but generally, these topics distract from more productive technical discussion.
